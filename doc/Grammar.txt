TC Grammar
==========

Whitespaces are ignored and comments can be entered, 
starting from '#' and spanning until the end of the line.

Each evaluation consists of 1 line which consists of either
an expression or an assignment.
All expressions are evaluated in double precision floating point.

Assignment grammar is "symbol = expression"
Expression grammar is what you would generally expect, and a set of
mathematical functions are provided.

A few examples:

 - 4 + 3.5
 - 0.124 * (6 + 12) / 3
 - 4 * sin(2*pi/3)
 - angle = asin(0.15)

A set of special commands are available in interactive mode:
 - exit, quit, q: exit the interactive shell
 - help: print this document
 - functions: print the list of supported functions
 - grammar: print the EBNF grammar reference
