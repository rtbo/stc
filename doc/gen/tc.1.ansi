[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mtc [22mis a simple Terminal Calculator. It can be provided expressions to
       evaluate on the command line, or it can enter in interactive shell
       mode.

       If expressions are provided on the command line, they will be evaluated
       in order, and program will exit unless [1m--interactive [22mis specified.

       If no expression argument is provided, program will enter interactive
       mode regardless of the [1m--interactive [22mswitch.

       The [1m--strip [22moption is only used for evaluation of expressions on the
       command line. If provided, [1mtc [22mwill print the bare result of evaluation
       and exit. This is useful to parse [1mtc[22m's output from scripts.

   [1mInteractive shell usage[0m
       When prompted, user can type expressions (with or without assignment).
       The expression is evaluated when ENTER is pressed.

       Up and Down keys navigate in the expression history. Left and Right
       keys move the cursor in the expression.

       A set of special ':' prefixed commands are available in the interactive
       shell:

       â€¢   [1m:quit[22m, [1m:q[22m, [1m:exit[22m: exit the program

       â€¢   [1m:functions[22m: page the list of supported functions

       â€¢   [1m:manual[22m, [1m:man[22m: page this manual

       â€¢   [1m:grammar[22m: print the EBNF grammar reference

       â€¢   [1m:copy [4m[22m[ARG][24m, [1m:cp [4m[22m[ARG][24m: copy to clipboard

           â€¢   [4mARG[24m can be a variable name or evaluation history index

           â€¢   the last evaluated value if no [4mARG[0m

       Pressing [4mCtrl-C[24m or [4mESC[24m key will exit the shell.

   [1mGrammar[0m
       Whitespaces are ignored and comments can be entered, starting from #
       and spanning until the end of the line.

       Each evaluation consists of one line which is either an expression or
       an assignment. All expressions are evaluated in double precision
       floating point.

       Expression grammar is what you would generally expect for ASCII
       arithmetic expressions (see the [1mExpression examples [22mhereunder for a
       quick tuto).

       Assignment grammar is variable = expression. Once a variable is
       assigned, it can be reused in latter expressions. Variables pi and e
       are initialized at the start. Expressions that are not assigned to a
       user variable, are assigned to the special ans variable, which can also
       be reused in latter expressions like any other variable.

       The following operators are supported, listed in precedence order:

       â€¢   [1m^[0m

       â€¢   [1m+[22m, [1m- [22m(unary)

       â€¢   [1m*[22m, [1m/[22m, [1m%[0m

       â€¢   [1m+[22m, [1m-[0m

       A set of mathematical functions are provided, such as [4msin[24m, [4msqrt[24m, or [4mln[24m.
       Trigonometric functions accept angles in radians only. Functions [4mrads[0m
       and [4mdegs[24m convert to degrees to radians and radians to degrees
       respectively. The [1m:functions [22mcommand or [1m--functions [22moption print the
       full list of supported functions.
