[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mtc  [22mis a simple Terminal Calculator.  It can be provided expressions to
       evaluate on the command line, or it  can  enter  in  interactive  shell
       mode.

       If expressions are provided on the command line, they will be evaluated
       in order, and program will exit unless [1m‚Äìinteractive [22mis specified.

       If  no  expression argument is provided, program will enter interactive
       mode regardless of the [1m‚Äìinteractive [22mswitch.

       The [1m‚Äìstrip [22moption is only used for evaluation  of  expressions  on  the
       command line.  If provided, [1mtc [22mwill print the bare result of evaluation
       and exit.  This is useful to parse [1mtc[22m‚Äôs output from scripts.

   [1mInteractive shell usage[0m
       When  prompted, user can type expressions (with or without assignment).
       The expression is evaluated when ENTER is pressed.

       Up and Down keys navigate in the expression history.   Left  and  Right
       keys move the cursor in the expression.

       A set of special `:' prefixed commands are available in the interactive
       shell:

       ‚Ä¢ [1m:quit[22m, [1m:q[22m, [1m:exit[22m: exit the program

       ‚Ä¢ [1m:functions[22m: page the list of supported functions

       ‚Ä¢ [1m:manual[22m, [1m:man[22m: page this manual

       ‚Ä¢ [1m:grammar[22m: print the EBNF grammar reference

       Pressing Ctrl-C or ESC key will exit the shell.

   [1mGrammar[0m
       Whitespaces  are  ignored  and comments can be entered, starting from [1m#[0m
       and spanning until the end of the line.

       Each evaluation consists of one line which is either an  expression  or
       an  assignment.   All  expressions  are  evaluated  in double precision
       floating point.

       Expression grammar is what you would generally expect for ASCII  arith‚Äê
       metic expressions (see the [4mexamples[24m hereunder for a quick tuto).

       Assignment  grammar  is  [1mvariable = expression[22m.  Once a variable is as‚Äê
       signed, it can be reused in latter expressions.  Variables [1mpi [22mand [1me [22mare
       initialized at the start.  Expressions that are not assigned to a  user
       variable,  are  assigned to the special [1mans [22mvariable, which can also be
       reused in latter expressions like any other variable.

       The following operators are supported, listed in precedence order:

       ‚Ä¢ [1m^[0m

       ‚Ä¢ [1m+[22m, [1m- [22m(unary)

       ‚Ä¢ [1m*[22m, [1m/[22m, [1m%[0m

       ‚Ä¢ [1m+[22m, [1m-[0m

       A set of mathematical functions are provided, such as [1msin[22m, [1msqrt[22m, or [1mln[22m.
       Trigonometric functions accept angles in radians only.  Functions  [1mrads[0m
       and  [1mdegs  [22mconvert to degrees to radians and radians to degrees respec‚Äê
       tively.
